# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

mtdev: mtdev (multitouch device library)
mtdev:
mtdev: mtdev is a stand-alone library which transforms all variants of
mtdev: kernel MT events to the slotted type B protocol.  The events put
mtdev: into mtdev may be from any MT device, specifically type A without
mtdev: contact tracking, type A with contact tracking, or type B with
mtdev: contact tracking.
mtdev: The bulk of the mtdev code has been out there since 2008 as part of
mtdev: the Multitouch X Driver.  With this package, finger tracking and 
mtdev: seamless MT protocol handling is available under a free license.
