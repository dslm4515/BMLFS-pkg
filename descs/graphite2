# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

graphite2: Graphite2 is a rendering engine for graphite fonts. These are

graphite2: non-Roman writing systems. They may contain rules for e.g. ligatures, 
graphite2: glyph substitution, kerning, justification - this can make them 
graphite2: useful even on text written in Roman writing systems such as English.
