# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

tlsdate: tlsdate (secure parasitic rdate replacement)
tlsdate:
tlsdate: tlsdate sets the local clock by securely connecting with TLS to 
tlsdate: remote servers and extracting the remote time out of the secure 
tlsdate: handshake. Unlike ntpdate, tlsdate uses TCP, for instance connecting 
tlsdate: to a remote HTTPS or TLS enabled service, and provides some 
tlsdate: protection against adversaries that try to feed you malicious time 
tlsdate: information.
