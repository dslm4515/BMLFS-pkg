# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

fuse3:
fuse3: FUSE is a simple interface for userspace programs to export a virtual
fuse3: filesystem to the Linux kernel. FUSE also aims to provide a secure
fuse3: method for non privileged users to create and mount their own
fuse3: filesystem implementations.
