# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

gptfdisk: gptfdisk (GPT fdisk utilities)
gptfdisk:
gptfdisk: GPT fdisk (consisting of the gdisk, cgdisk, sgdisk, and fixparts
gptfdisk: programs) is a set of text-mode partitioning tools for using a GPT
gptfdisk: (GUID Partition Table), rather than the traditional MBR (Master Boot
gptfdisk: Record) partition tables. It features several partitioning tools,
gptfdisk: recovery tools to help you deal with corrupt partition tables, and the
gptfdisk: ability to convert MBR disks to GPT format.
