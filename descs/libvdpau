# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libvdpau: libvdpau (VDPAU wrapper library)
libvdpau:
libvdpau: This package contains the libvdpau wrapper library and the
libvdpau: libvdpau_trace debugging library, along with the header files needed
libvdpau: to build VDPAU applications. To actually use a VDPAU device, you
libvdpau: need a vendor-specific implementation library, like the one
libvdpau: shipped with nvidia's binary graphics driver.
