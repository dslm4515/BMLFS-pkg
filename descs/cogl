# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

cogl: cogl (library for using 3D graphics hardware for rendering)
cogl:
cogl: Cogl is a small open source library for using 3D graphics hardware
cogl: for rendering. The API departs from the flat state machine style of
cogl: OpenGL and is designed to make it easy to write orthogonal
cogl: components that can render without stepping on each others toes.
